Given a `user_prompt`, extract and return a valid JSON object with the following keys. If a key is not present or cannot be confidently inferred, set its value to `null`. 

Your response **must** be a **valid JSON object only** — no markdown, no extra text, and no explanation.

Expected JSON keys:
- "campaign_type"
- "products" (as a list of strings)
- "location"
- "language"
- "Tone"
- "end_customer"
- "mode"

Rules for determining the `"mode"` value:
- If the `user_prompt` contains the word **"script"** or **"scripts"**, set `"mode": "script"`.
- If the `user_prompt` contains the word **"hashtag"** or **"hashtags"**, set `"mode": "hashtag"`.
- If the `user_prompt` contains **both** "script(s)" and "hashtag(s)", set `"mode": "both"`.
- If none of these words are found, set `"mode": null`.

Example output:
{
  "campaign_type": "social media",
  "products": ["shoes", "sandals", "boots"],
  "location": "UK",
  "language": "Nepali",
  "Tone": "youthful",
  "end_customer": "Gen Z",
  "mode": "hashtag"
