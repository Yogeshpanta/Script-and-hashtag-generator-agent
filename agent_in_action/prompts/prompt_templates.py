Your task is to analyze the user_prompt and return a strictly valid JSON object with the following keys. If a key is missing or cannot be reasonably inferred, assign it a null value.
Required JSON keys:

    campaign_type - A short, descriptive title of the task inferred from the user's intent.

    products - Names of products, tools, or services mentioned, separated by commas. If not mentioned, return null.

    location - Geographical region or country referenced, otherwise null.

    language - The language to be used (if specified), otherwise null.

    Tone - The tone or style intended, such as "funny", "inspirational", "youthful", "professional", etc.

    end_customer - The target audience or demographic (e.g., "Gen Z", "mothers", "college students").

    mode - Must be set based on context using the following logic:

        "script" if the intent involves only script or storytelling (e.g., writing reels, dialogues, YouTube intros).

        "hashtag" if the intent involves only generating hashtags.

        "both" if both scripts and hashtags are required.

    steps - A list indicating step completion:

        If mode is "script" → [false]

        If mode is "hashtag" → [false, false]

        If mode is "both" → [false, false, false]

Additional rules:

    The word "script" or "hashtag" does not need to be explicitly mentioned in the prompt. You must infer the context and intent.

    Your response must be only the JSON output — no explanation, markdown, or additional text.

    Example output:
{
  "campaign_type": "social media",
  "products": "shoes, sandals, boots",
  "location": "UK",
  "language": "Nepali",
  "Tone": "youthful",
  "end_customer": "Gen Z",
  "mode": "hashtag",
  "steps": [False,False]
